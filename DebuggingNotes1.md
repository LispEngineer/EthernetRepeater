# Debugging Notes 1

**This is being tested with RGMII mode and a link established at 10M/Full.**

First packet transmitted!

This packet was received with a CRC error and a length error, per the counters
in my Ubuntu 22 LTS.

`f5ffffffffff6f0037f2fbfb1b600080000060200080600037f2fbfb0b08f4fb0b0000000000f0ffffff0f000000000000000000000000000000a0ded0c2`

Here is what was received:
```
f5 ff ff ff ff ff
6f 00 37 f2 fb fb
1b 60 
00 80

```

Here's what we were trying to send:
```
ff ff ff ff ff ff
06 e0 4c DF DF DF
08 06

00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00
75 0B 4B 43 (or maybe it's the other way around)
```

Some conclusions:
* It got the correct number of bytes
* It looks like both the nibbles AND the bit order may be wrong
  * FB = 1111_1011
  * DF = 1101_1111
  * 20 = 0010_0000
  * 04 = 0000_0100
* Looks like some of the bits aren't transmitted/received correctly

# Packet 2

Reversed the order in the bits for each nibble. Received this:

```
d5 ff ff ff ff ff 
7f 03 70 a6 ef ef 
6f 04 
03 80 
00 00 
00
03
02 80
00 03 70 a6 ef ef
6f 08 90 ef
6f 00 00 00 00 00 
80 ff ff ff 
7f 00 00 00 00 00 00 00
00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 
80 ba 85 a5

```

This looks even worse. Let me delay the clock 90‚Å∞.
