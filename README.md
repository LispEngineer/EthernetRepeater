# DE2-115 Ethernet Repeater

Copyright &copy; 2023 Douglas P. Fields, Jr. All Rights Reserved.

# Overview

**Ultimate goal:**

Build a SystemVerilog system that reads Ethernet packets on one port and
reflects them directly out another port, and vice versa, allowing the
FPGA to be a bidirectional repeater.

**Initial goals:**

Do all these things without a soft processor.

* Build an MDC/MDIO interface to read all the ports.
  * Display them on the 7-segment displays
* Build an MCD/MDIO interface to write (and read) all the ports.
* Build an interface that sends a simple ARP request packet
  * Calculate CRC
  * Send at 10BASE-T
  * Send at 100BASE-TX
  * Send at 1000BASE-T
* Build an interface that reads a single packet
  * Display information on 7-seg
  * Display information on LCD
  * Display information on VGA or DVI
  * Send packet information via USB UART

## Hardware

**[Terasic DE2-115](https://www.terasic.com.tw/cgi-bin/page/archive.pl?Language=English&CategoryNo=139&No=502&PartNo=4)**

This board has two 10/100/1000 copper Ethernet ports connected by a 
[Marvel 88E1111 PHY](https://www.marvell.com/content/dam/marvell/en/public-collateral/transceivers/marvell-phys-transceivers-alaska-88e1111-datasheet.pdf),
capable of MII and GRMII modes (selectable by jumper). The main FPGA is
a Cyclone IV. It has a lot of I/O but no digital display - which can be
added by HSMC card. Some useful features:

* Lots of memory: SRAM, SDRAM, Flash, EEPROM and SD card
* Lots of on-board user I/O: LEDs, 7-segments, buttons, switches, LCD
* Lots of external I/O: RS-232, USB UART, VGA, Audio, PS2
* Expansion: GPIO, EX_IO, HSMC, SMA

...and some not very useful stuff like a TV Decoder.

## Development Software

* Quartus Lite 21.1.0 Build 842
* Questa Intel Starter FPGA Edition-64 2021.2 (previously known as ModelSim)




# Current Functionality

* Management Interface
  * Not tested on real PHY
  * Visually simulated in Questa

## Open Questions

* During Management Interface idle periods - should I continue to run MDC?
  * Seems unnecessary and a waste of energy

## Known Bugs

* On my DE2-115, enabling the Ethernet (RST_N to 1) on both ports
  causes ETH0 to be unreponsive when plugged in, but ETH1 reponds
  just fine and lights up 1000, DUP, RX lights.

# TODO

* Simulate the PHY side of the Management Interface (for reads)
* Enable reduced preamble mode for Management Interface?


# Notes on FPGA Resources

## ALTIOBUF

[Intel ALTIOBUF docs](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/docs/programmable/683471/19-1/ip-core-user-guide.html)

* Add `ALTIOBUF`
* Bidirectional buffer
* Use open drain output (like I2C bus, MDC is pulled high)
  * From docs: "can be asserted by multiple devices in your system"
* Do not generate a netlist (we don't use a 3P EDA synthesis tool)
* Generate the Instantiation Template File (not really needed, it's easy, but whatever)
* Generate the Symbol File (although we won't use it)

Remember - the `inout` must be a SystemVerilog `wire` and not `logic` or else it
won't work.

# Notes on Test Harness

Ensure Quartus Settings -> Simulation shows `Questa Intel FPGA`

Do not use `$finish;` in your simulation - it will quit Questa
and you will have to do everything below all over again!

* Run Questa: `Tools -> Run Simulation Tool -> RTL Simulation...`
* To restart simulation: `Simulate -> Restart...`
* You can save your waves
* You can load saved waves with File -> Load -> Macro File... and then
  choose `test1-wave.do`

Setting up Quartus to load the Test Harness in Questa
* See [Quick Start](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/docs/programmable/703090/21-1/simulation-quick-start.html)
  documentation section 1.2, figures 3-4
* Quartus: Assignments -> Settings -> EDA Tool Settings -> Simulation
* NativeLink Settings -> Compile test bench
* Click `Test Benches...` then `New`
* Add a name (e.g., `testbench_1`) and specify the `test_whatever` as top-level module
* Add all the file `test_whatever.sv` and `other.sv` and mark it as SystemVerilog
* NOW, when you run the `RTL Simulation` it will open this by default.
* You will still need to save the waves as you like them and reload them (per above).
* When you change things, you still have to right-click & `Recompile` in the `Library`
  * This is a long command in `VSIM ##>` prompt
* Then you can type at the `VSIM ##>` prompt `restart -f ; run -all`
